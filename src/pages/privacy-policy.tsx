        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Privacy Policy Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This document, referred to as the "Policy," outlines the procedures for collecting,
          safeguarding, and utilizing personally identifiable information ("Personal Information")
          that you may provide on the Mysaandco.com.au website ("Website" or "Service") and its
          associated products and services, collectively known as the "Services." The Policy also
          details the options at your disposal concerning how we use your Personal Information and
          how you can access and modify this data. It's essential to recognize that this Policy
          constitutes a legally binding agreement between you, and Mysa & Co. By accessing and
          utilizing the Website and Services, you explicitly acknowledge that you have perused,
          comprehended, and concurred to abide by the stipulations of this Policy. It's important to
          note that this Policy does not pertain to the practices of businesses that we neither own
          nor control or to individuals we do not employ or supervise.
        </p>
        <h2>Automatic Information Collection</h2>
        <p>
          Our utmost concern is the security of customer data, which is why we adhere to a strict
          no-logs policy. We may only process the minimal amount of user data essential for the
          maintenance of the Website and Services. Automatically collected information serves the
          sole purpose of recognizing potential instances of misuse and compiling statistical
          insights about the utilization and traffic patterns of the Website and Services. This
          statistical data is not aggregated in a manner that would enable the identification of
          individual system users.
        </p>
        <h2>Collection of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          You have the option to explore and utilize the Website and Services without revealing your
          identity or any information that could pinpoint you as a specific individual. However, if
          you choose to access certain features on the Website, you may be requested to furnish
          specific Personal Information, such as your name and email address. We securely receive
          and store any information you willingly provide, whether it's during account creation,
          content publication, making a purchase, or completing online forms on the Website. This
          data may encompass:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal particulars, including name, country of residence, and more.</li>
          <li>Contact details, such as your email address and physical address.</li>
          <li>Account specifics, such as a username, unique user ID, password, and the like.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A portion of the data we gather is directly obtained from you through interactions with
          the Website and Services. Yet, we may also obtain Personal Information about you from
          alternative sources, including publicly available databases and our partners in joint
          marketing ventures. You retain the choice of whether to supply us with your Personal
          Information, but it's essential to note that not doing so might restrict your access to
          specific Website features. Users seeking clarity about mandatory information can always
          reach out to us.
        </p>
        <h2>Use and Processing of Collected Information</h2>
        <p>
          In order to provide you with the Website and Services, or to fulfill legal requirements,
          we may require the collection and utilization of specific Personal Information. Failure to
          provide requested information may result in our inability to furnish the products or
          services you've requested. The information we collect from you can be employed for the
          subsequent purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>Responding to legal requests and averting harm.</li>
          <li>Facilitating the operation and management of the Website and Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The processing of your Personal Information hinges on your interaction with the Website
          and Services, your geographical location, and the presence of the following conditions:
          (i) your consent granted for one or more specific purposes. This doesn't apply when
          processing Personal Information is subject to European data protection regulations. (ii)
          the necessity of information provision for the performance of an agreement with you and/or
          fulfillment of pre-contractual obligations. (iii) compliance with a legal obligation to
          which you are subject. (iv) processing related to a task carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us. (v) processing required
          for the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's essential to note that under certain laws, we may continue to process information
          until you object to such processing (via opting out), without having to rely on consent or
          other aforementioned legal bases. We are available to clarify the specific legal basis
          applicable to the processing, including whether the provision of Personal Information is a
          statutory or contractual requirement or a prerequisite to entering into an agreement.
        </p>
        <h2>Billing and Payments</h2>
        <p>
          It's noted that third-party payment processors are used for secure payment processing. The
          privacy of such information is governed by the policies of these processors, which may
          differ from this policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Managing Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          You have the ability to remove specific Personal Information that we have on record about
          you. The type of Personal Information that you can delete may vary as the Website and
          Services evolve. Nevertheless, when you decide to delete Personal Information, please be
          aware that we may retain an unaltered copy of your Personal Information in our records for
          the duration required to adhere to our commitments to our affiliates and partners, as well
          as for the reasons outlined below. If you wish to erase your Personal Information or
          deactivate your account permanently, you can accomplish this by visiting the settings page
          of your account on the Website.
        </p>
        <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          In order to fulfill your requested Services or complete transactions, we may, with your
          consent, share your information with our trusted third-party partners who collaborate with
          us, along with any affiliated companies and subsidiaries essential for the operation of
          the Website and Services provided to you. We do not distribute Personal Information to
          unrelated third parties. These service providers are solely authorized to utilize or
          disclose your information as needed to perform services on our behalf or adhere to legal
          obligations. Your Personal Information may be shared with third parties for these explicit
          purposes, provided that their privacy policies align with ours or they agree to adhere to
          our guidelines regarding Personal Information. These third parties are granted access to
          Personal Information solely for the performance of their designated functions, and we do
          not permit them to exploit or expose Personal Information for their independent marketing
          or other objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          In cases where it is legally required or allowed, such as complying with a subpoena or a
          similar legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is vital to
          safeguard our rights, your safety, or the safety of others, investigate fraudulent
          activities, or respond to governmental inquiries, we will reveal any Personal Information
          that we have collected, used, or received.
        </p>
        <p>
          In scenarios where we undergo a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another
          firm, or the sale of some or all of our assets, your user account and Personal Information
          are likely to be part of the transferred assets
        </p>
        <h2>Information Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Your Personal Information will be retained and utilized for the duration necessary to meet
          our legal obligations, settle disputes, and enforce our agreements. This retention period
          will persist unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. After you
          update or delete your Personal Information, we may employ aggregated data derived from or
          including your Personal Information, but not in a way that could personally identify you.
          Following the conclusion of the designated retention period, your Personal Information
          will be deleted. Consequently, the rights related to accessing, erasing, rectifying, and
          transferring your data cannot be exercised once the retention period has lapsed.
        </p>
        <h2>User's Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You possess specific rights in connection with the information we process. In particular,
          you have the ability to: (i) withdraw your consent when you've previously granted it for
          the processing of your information; (ii) object to the processing of your information if
          such processing relies on legal grounds other than consent; (iii) ascertain if your
          information is undergoing processing by us, receive details concerning specific aspects of
          the processing, and secure a copy of the information that is currently being processed;
          (iv) authenticate the accuracy of your information and request corrections or updates as
          needed; (v) under certain circumstances, restrict the processing of your information,
          during which time we will exclusively retain your information without engaging in any
          other processing activities; (vi) under specific circumstances, request the deletion of
          your Personal Information from our records; (vii) receive your information in a
          structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, and potentially, transmit it to
          another data controller without any obstructions, provided that this clause applies to
          information processed by automated means and based on your consent, your contractual
          involvement, or pre-contractual obligations.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy of Children</h2>
        <p>
          It is our policy not to intentionally gather any Personal Information from individuals
          below the age of 18. If you are under 18, we kindly request that you refrain from
          transmitting any Personal Information via the Website and Services. We strongly advise
          parents and legal guardians to supervise their children's internet activities and to
          assist in upholding this Policy by educating their children about refraining from
          divulging Personal Information through the Website and Services without appropriate
          authorization. Should you have reason to suspect that a person under 18 has furnished us
          with Personal Information via the Website and Services, please do not hesitate to reach
          out to us. Furthermore, it is essential that you possess the legal capacity to provide
          consent for the processing of your Personal Information in your residing country. In
          specific jurisdictions, we might grant permission for your parent or guardian to act on
          your behalf in this regard.
        </p>
        <h2>Usage of "Cookies"</h2>
        <p>
          The Website and Services employ "cookies" to enhance and tailor your online experience. A
          cookie constitutes a text file deposited on your hard drive by a web page server.
          Importantly, cookies lack the functionality to execute programs or deliver viruses to your
          computer. They are exclusively linked to you and can only be accessed by a web server
          within the domain that initially issued the cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may utilize cookies to amass, retain, and trace information for statistical objectives,
          ensuring the smooth operation of the Website and Services. You hold the capability to
          either accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
          typically, you can adjust your browser settings to decline them if you prefer. To gain a
          more comprehensive understanding of cookies and their operations, please refer to this
          resource.
        </p>
        <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        <p>
          Certain web browsers come equipped with a Do Not Track feature, which sends a signal to
          the websites you browse, indicating your preference not to have your online activities
          monitored. It's essential to distinguish tracking from the typical use or collection of
          information related to a website. In this context, tracking pertains to the gathering of
          personally identifiable data from individuals who visit a website or online service,
          especially as they navigate various sites over time. The Website and Services do not
          engage in tracking their visitors across different websites or over extended periods.
          Nevertheless, some third-party websites may monitor your online browsing activities when
          providing content, allowing them to customize their offerings to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>
          This section allows certain third-party companies to assist in advertising tailored to
          users and collect data on user activities on the Website.
        </p>
        <h2>Affiliates</h2>
        <p>
          The engagement in affiliate marketing through affiliate links is mentioned, with cookies
          used to track sales for commissions.
        </p>
        <h2>Email Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          We extend the option to voluntarily subscribe to our electronic newsletters at any time.
          You can rest assured that we're firmly committed to maintaining the confidentiality of
          your email address and will not disclose it to any third parties, except as permissible in
          the information use and processing section, or for the purpose of utilizing a third-party
          provider to dispatch such emails. We will uphold the information transmitted via email in
          accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          To comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, every email dispatched by us will conspicuously display
          the sender's identity and provide clear contact details. If you wish to cease receiving
          our newsletters or marketing emails, you can do so by following the unsubscribe
          instructions contained within these emails or by getting in touch with us. Please note,
          however, that you will continue to receive crucial transactional emails.
        </p>
        <h2>External Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Our Website and Services feature connections to other resources that are neither owned nor
          overseen by us. It's important to note that we do not bear responsibility for the privacy
          practices of these external resources or third parties. We advise you to exercise caution
          when departing from our Website and Services and to carefully review the privacy policies
          of any and all resources that may gather Personal Information.
        </p>
        <h2>Security of Information</h2>
        <p>
          We take measures to protect the information you provide, storing it on secure computer
          servers within a controlled environment to prevent unauthorized access, use, or
          disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
          prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure of Personal Information
          within our control and custody. Nevertheless, it's essential to recognize that (i) the
          Internet has inherent security and privacy limitations beyond our control; (ii) we cannot
          guarantee the security, integrity, and privacy of information and data exchanged between
          you and the Website and Services; and (iii) despite our best efforts, such information and
          data may be subject to viewing or tampering by a third party during transmission.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Breach </h2>
        <p>
          In the circumstance that we detect a breach in the security of our Website and Services,
          or if we discover that users' Personal Information has been exposed to unaffiliated third
          parties due to external activities such as security breaches or fraudulent actions, we
          maintain the prerogative to undertake suitable actions. These actions may encompass, but
          are not confined to, conducting an investigation, reporting the incident, and
          collaborating with law enforcement authorities. Should a data breach occur, we will exert
          diligent efforts to inform affected individuals if we deem there is a credible risk of
          harm ensuing from the breach or if statutory obligations necessitate such notification. In
          such an event, we will promptly dispatch an email to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes and Amendments </h2>
        <p>
          We maintain the privilege to make adjustments and amendments to this Policy or its
          conditions concerning the Website and Services at our discretion. We will inform you of
          any substantial modifications to how we handle Personal Information. In such instances, we
          will update the date displayed at the bottom of this page. We may also decide to provide
          you with notice using other methods at our discretion, including the contact details you
          have supplied. Any updated edition of this Policy will become effective immediately upon
          publication, unless otherwise specified. By continuing to use the Website and Services
          after the effective date of the revised Policy (or any other action specified at that
          time), you express your consent to these changes. Nevertheless, we will not, without your
          consent, employ your Personal Information in a manner that significantly deviates from
          what was conveyed at the time your Personal Information was obtained.
        </p>
        <h2>Acceptance of this Policy </h2>
