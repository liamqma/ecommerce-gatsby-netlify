        <h2>Account Management and Membership</h2>
        <p>
          Upon creating an account on the Website, you assume responsibility for upholding the
          account's security and accept full accountability for all activities conducted under the
          account, as well as any associated actions. While we retain the option to review and
          scrutinize new accounts, we are under no obligation to do so before enabling you to sign
          in and commence using the Services. The provision of inaccurate contact information in any
          form may lead to the termination of your account. You are obligated to promptly inform us
          of any unauthorized account usage or any security breaches. It's important to note that we
          shall not be held liable for any of your acts or oversights, including any resultant
          damages. If we conclude that you have breached any clause of this Agreement or that your
          behavior or content is likely to harm our reputation and standing, we maintain the right
          to suspend, deactivate, or erase your account, either in part or in its entirety. Should
          we delete your account for the aforementioned reasons, you will be prohibited from
          re-registering for our Services. Additionally, we may obstruct your email address and
          Internet protocol address to forestall future registrations.
        </p>
        <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
          Any data, information, or materials (collectively referred to as "Content") that you
          submit while using the Service on the Website are not our property. You bear full
          responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability,
          appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or the right to use all Content you
          submit. We reserve the right to monitor and assess the Content created or submitted by you
          on the Website using our Services. By utilizing our Services, you grant us permission to
          access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display, and perform the Content
          found in your user account solely for the purpose of delivering the Services to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the representations and warranties mentioned, we possess the discretion,
          though not the obligation, to reject or delete any Content that, in our reasonable
          judgment, breaches our policies or is in any way detrimental or objectionable.
          Furthermore, you provide us with a license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish, or
          distribute the Content you've created or stored in your user account for commercial,
          marketing, or any similar purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Billing and Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for settling all fees or charges associated with your account,
          following the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect when a fee or charge becomes due.
          If, in our assessment, your purchase is deemed a high-risk transaction, we may request
          that you furnish us with a valid government-issued photo identification and potentially a
          recent bank statement for the credit or debit card employed for the purchase. We maintain
          the right to modify both products and product pricing at our discretion. Moreover, we
          reserve the privilege to reject any order you make with us. We may, at our sole
          discretion, impose limits on or cancel the quantities bought per individual, per
          household, or per order. These constraints might encompass orders placed under the same
          customer account, with the same credit card, or utilizing identical billing and/or
          shipping details. If we decide to modify or cancel an order, we will make an effort to
          reach out to you via the contact details provided during the order placement, which may
          include email or the billing address and phone number on record.

          of which can be done without prior notice, even after you've placed your order. However,
